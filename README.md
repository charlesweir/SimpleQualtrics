# SimpleQualtrics

Python module to support Qualtrics' APIs.

SimpleQualtrics is a stand-alone single-class API to access the Qualtrics APIs directly,
handling all of the Qualtrics web-specific protocols in a robust manner and
answering data structures that are easy to process in Python.

Specifically, it implements separating credentials from code,
configuration handling, choice of API server, practical error handling, call timeouts,
call logging, and Python-friendly decoding of Qualtrics response formats and protocols.
